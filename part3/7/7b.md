Should You Start Using Docker? Yes!

Docker is a set of tools that helps software developers to develop and deliver software in containers. A container is an isolated environment which enables software to be environment agnostic. Therefore setting up sufficient production environment for a web application is both easier and more reliable with Docker, and the development environment could be much closer to the production without having the trouble to individually set everything up on every developers personal computers.

Docker is well documented and widely practiced, which makes it easy to start work with. An existing project can be “wrapped into a container” or  “dockerized”, and if you would like to learn more, just pull a public and maintained image of a familiar product and start your very own sandbox project.

Whether to use Docker in your project or not, most definitely the answer is yes. It will ease up the CI/CD pipeline of the project and it will help with complex interlinked systems that depend on each other, use the same resources, and need to communicate. Docker is so easy to apply as a simple configuration file for a small project that you should just give it a try. For a bigger project there is more configuration ahead but using docker-compose should help governing the whole system so that you do not want to look back once it has been done.
